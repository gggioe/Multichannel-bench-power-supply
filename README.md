# Modular-DC-bench-power-supply

Like the DC load project, this is a work in progress. To be fair, it all started from this power supply project, then since i had almost no proper instrument to test it i switched on build a dc load. I have a few MIC29752 around, for those who don't know this IC is basically a linear regulator (like a lm317) on steroid (capable of 7.5A). The best thing is that it offers good precision in a compact form factor, since it is all integrated into a single package i don't have to deal with thermal compensation etc. I saw on the internet some projects based on it however, it is used as a really basic variable output 317. Since this ic is capable of 7.5A, with a Vin=26V and Vout=5V for example, the total power dissipated will be around 157W at the full current...
My idea was to try to push it to the limit and build a good power supply (24V 7.5A) that can squeeze the full potential from this ic. The main goal is: efficiency, modularity, isolation and (hopefully) stability. Like the dc load project, there is no ETA, part of the schematic is almost complete and tested however, i plan to release a fully functional hardware schematic after the DC load project. To be clear, in order to keep low the total BOM cost, i will keep the schematic as basic as possible however, in order to achieve precision and efficiency parts like ADC, DAC and tracking pre-regulator are mandatory.
